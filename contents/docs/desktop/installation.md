# Neo4j Desktop

The Neo4j Developer site has a wonderful step by step guide to download and install, and guide you through the parts of this application. If you haven't done so already, [check it out](https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-desktop/).

## Remote Connections

Typically, your development / production envrionment is not on the local machine. Neo4j enabled remote connections for scenarios such as this, within the Desktop application. To connect to a remote Neo4j instance, please follow [this guide](https://docs.graphenedb.com/docs/connecting-to-your-database-instance-from-neo4j-desktop).

## Proxy Configuration

Behind your company's infrastructure? You're in luck because Neo4j Desktop ships with a proxy configuration OOB. There are a number of ways to enable the Proxy, so [here](https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/proxy-setting-for-neo4j-desktop/) is an article to guide you through the process.

## Developer Settings

To enable the Developer Settings, please follow the following [tutorial](https://github.com/neo4j-apps/graph-app-starter#development-mode).
